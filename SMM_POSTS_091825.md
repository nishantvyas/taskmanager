## üöÄ The Solo Founder's Task Management Problem (And My Simple Solution)

**Ever opened JIRA just to add "fix that bug" to your to-do list?**

Yeah, me too. And I immediately regretted it.

You know what? I got tired of JIRA and all those heavy task management tools.

I'm a solo founder. I don't need to assign tickets to anyone. I don't need to track hours or have 15 different status columns. 

I just need to know: what do I need to do, and did I actually finish it?

So I built my own Chrome extension for task management. Simple. Clean. Just for people like me.

It opens as your new tab page because let's be honest - the browser is our portal to everything these days. Why add more friction by opening another website and logging in?

## üéØ Gamification That Actually Works

Here's the thing though... I needed something to push myself.

I discovered that streaks work better than any complex tracking system.

My extension shows me a GitHub-style activity matrix. You know, those green squares that show your daily commits?

But instead of code commits, it tracks task completions. 

I can see my streak. I can see which days I actually got stuff done vs the days I just... well, didn't.

Sometimes the best motivation is just seeing that visual proof that you're making progress.

The tricky part? Making it feel rewarding without being overwhelming.

## üåê Why Chrome Extension + Full Privacy

Everyone asks me: "Why a Chrome extension?"

Well, validation systems can be... complicated when you're building web apps.

But here's the real reason: friction kills productivity.

I mean, it works but... opening a new website, logging in, waiting for it to load - that's like 30 seconds of friction every single time. 

Your browser is already open. It's literally your doorway to the digital world.

So I made my task manager replace the new tab page. Every time you open a tab, there are your tasks. Your countdown timer. Your progress.

Here's what makes this different from other task apps:

Everything runs locally. No internet required. No database. No servers.

Your data lives in your browser's local storage. I don't see it, track it, or store it anywhere else.

No accounts, no logins, no "forgot password" nonsense.

No "In Progress" or "Under Review" or "Waiting for Stakeholder Approval." 

Just: Do I need to do this? Or did I finish it?

Drag-and-drop between To-Do and Done. Multiple projects with dropdown switching. Export/import JSON files if you want to move your data.

It's actually open source too: https://github.com/nishantvyas/taskmanager

Sometimes the best fix is knowing when NOT to add more steps to the process.

## ü§î Should I Put This on Chrome Web Store?

Right now you have to install it manually (developer mode). But I'm thinking... Should I submit this to the Chrome Web Store so you can install it with one click?
